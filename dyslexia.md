## Designing for users with dyslexia

### Do...

* use images and diagrams to support text
* align text to the left and keep a consistent layout
* consider producing materials in other formats (for example, audio or video)
* keep content short, clear and simple
* let users change the contrast be- tween background and text

### Don’t...

* use large blocks of heavy text
* underline words, use italics or write in capitals
    * DON’T DO THIS
* force users to remember things from previous pages - give reminders and prompts
* rely on accurate spelling - use autocorrect or provide suggestions
    * dyslexia
    * dsyle
* put too much information in one place
